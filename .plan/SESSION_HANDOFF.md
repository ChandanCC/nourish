# Session Handoff

**Date:** 2026-05-08
**Session:** Implementation session 2 (continuation)

---

## What Was Completed This Session

All remaining implementation tasks from the DEPENDENCY_GRAPH execution plan:

### Phase 07 — Frontend Integration (P07-001→P07-006)
- `useHomeScreen`, `useLogEntry`, `useDeleteEntry` hooks via TanStack Query
- `GET /api/home` returns `entries: FoodEntrySummary[]` (added to payload)
- App.tsx rewritten: drives all four zones from real backend data
- SignalZone, TodayZone, LogZone, EntryCard all use live FoodEntry/HomeScreenPayload types
- HomeScreen simplified to layout shell (`children` only, no direct SignalZone render)

### Phase 08 — Motion System (P08-001→P08-006)
- **CSS**: `@keyframes entryArrival`, `--ease-arrive/depart/data` tokens in `:root`
- P08-001: SignalZone fades in 400ms linear on mount
- P08-002: EntryCard arrival: `translateY(12px)→0` + fade, 200ms EASE-ARRIVE, 40ms stagger
- P08-003: `useCountUp` hook — rAF cubic ease-out 320ms; applied in MacroRow
- P08-004: Progress bar width animated 0→real, 320ms EASE-DATA, 80ms mount delay
- P08-005: Waveform bars rise from 0, 300ms EASE-DATA, 30ms stagger per bar
- P08-006: EntryCard expand/collapse — max-height + opacity, EASE-ARRIVE/DEPART

### Phase 09 — Onboarding (P09-001→P09-007)
- **User model**: `onboardingComplete`, `goal`, `proteinTargetG` fields added
- **`PATCH /api/user/onboarding`**: saves goal + protein target, marks onboarding done
- **`GET /api/home`**: now includes `onboardingComplete` in payload
- **3-screen onboarding**: WelcomeScreen → GoalSelectionScreen → ProteinTargetScreen
- State machine in App.tsx (no React Router — consistent with single-surface design)
- After save: `invalidateQueries(['home'])` triggers home screen refetch → READING state
- **SignalExplanation**: localStorage-gated bottom sheet (one-time, "Got it" dismisses)
- First SIGNAL recompute triggered once via `POST /api/signal/recompute` after onboarding

### Phase 10 — Hardening (P10-001→P10-004)
- `requestLogger` middleware: structured JSON per request, no PII, to stdout
- `validate(schema)` middleware factory: Zod validation at route boundary, 422 on failure
  - Applied to POST /api/logs (actual current schema) and PATCH /api/user/onboarding
- `ErrorBoundary` class component: zones degrade to `null` independently on error
- `helmet` configured with CSP `default-src 'self'`, HSTS prod-only, `x-powered-by` disabled
- CORS updated to include PATCH method

## Milestone Status

**M5 (Ship-Ready) reached. 48/48 tasks complete.**

---

## Git State

22 commits ahead of origin/main. All work committed. Branch: `main`.

Notable commits:
- `P07-001→P07-006: frontend wired to real backend data`
- `P08-001→P08-006: motion system — all six animation contracts`
- `P09-001→P09-007: onboarding flow and first-time SIGNAL explanation`
- `P10-001→P10-004: observability and hardening`

---

## Known Open Items

1. **P09-007 technical debt**: `POST /api/signal/recompute` in App.tsx uses raw `fetch` with localStorage token. Should use the axios API client. Low priority.

2. **Unresolved U-001**: Training section in TODAY zone shows static "TRAINING · Not logged" placeholder. Not wired. Deferred to v1.2.

3. **SignalState subtitle**: The backend's `home.ts` currently sets `subtitle: null` unconditionally. The SIGNAL engine's `tier1/tier2` outputs include a subtitle concept but it's not surfaced in the HomeScreenPayload signal object. Future session: map `currentSignal.subtitle` (if the SignalState model has it) to the payload.

4. **Deployment**: No deployment configuration exists (no `serverless.yml`, no `Dockerfile`, no CI/CD pipeline). This is the natural next phase before production.

---

## What's Next

The implementation plan is complete. The product is at M5. Natural next steps:

1. **Staging deployment**: Configure Lambda + API Gateway for the backend, Cloudfront/S3 or Vercel for the frontend.
2. **Production MongoDB Atlas**: Move from development cluster to production cluster with proper IP allowlists and connection pooling.
3. **End-to-end smoke test**: Create a test user, complete onboarding, log 7 days of meals, verify SIGNAL state transitions.
4. **Backend tests for routes**: The intelligence engine has unit tests (16 passing). The routes have no integration tests yet.

## Post-M5 Sessions

### 2026-05-08 — Infrastructure + Provider Architecture

**External dependency strategy** (`docs(infra): define external dependency and API strategy`):
- `.plan/engineering/api-dependency-map.md` — 8 services documented with 14 fields each
- `.env.example` — all env vars with classification
- `.plan/engineering/service-classification.md` — REQUIRED_NOW / MVP_LATER / PRODUCTION_ONLY / FUTURE_OPTIONAL / EXPERIMENTAL

**Provider-agnostic intelligence layer** (`refactor(ai): establish provider-agnostic intelligence architecture`):
- `backend/src/providers/` — `types.ts`, `anthropic.ts`, `registry.ts`
- All Anthropic-specific logic extracted from `analyse.ts` and `tier3.ts`
- `parsedByModel` now stamped by backend from `provider.canonicalId` — frontend no longer hardcodes model name
- `signal.ts` records `provider:model` canonical format in `SignalState.aiModel`
- Invariant B-003 updated to protect full provider boundary
- Docs: `provider-abstraction-audit.md`, `provider-abstraction.md`

**Gemini 2.5 Flash integration** (`feat(ai): integrate Gemini 2.5 Flash provider`):
- `backend/src/providers/google.ts` — `GoogleProvider` implementing `CompletionProvider`
- Uses `responseMimeType: 'application/json'` — enforces valid JSON output without regex stripping
- Registry defaults updated to Gemini 2.5 Flash as active default provider
- To use: set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `backend/.env` (no other changes needed)
- To revert to Anthropic: `AI_PROVIDER_PARSING=anthropic` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

**Current active defaults:**
```
AI_PROVIDER_PARSING=gemini     → gemini-2.5-flash
AI_PROVIDER_SYNTHESIS=gemini   → gemini-2.5-flash
```
